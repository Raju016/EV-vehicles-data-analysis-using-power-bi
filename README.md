# ðŸš— Electric Vehicles Analysis Dashboard â€“ Power BI
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of Electric Vehicles (EVs) using Power BI. The dashboard visualizes various aspects of EV adoption across regions, helping to uncover trends and patterns in the dataset. It covers key statistics such as total registered electric vehicles, their average range, and a breakdown by vehicle typeâ€”Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). Notably, BEVs account for 78% of the total, while PHEVs make up 22%.

The analysis also dives into the distribution of vehicles by model year, highlighting trends in recent EV adoption. Users can explore the top vehicle makes, with Tesla leading significantly, followed by Nissan and Chevrolet. The dashboard also showcases the top models like Model Y, Model 3, and Nissan Leaf, offering a clear view of which vehicles dominate the EV market.

Additionally, the project includes insights into CAFV (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle) eligibility, where a majority of vehicles fall under eligible or unknown categories. Geographic insights are also provided, displaying the number of registered EVs by U.S. state. To enhance exploration, interactive filter panels allow users to view data by city, electric utility, and EV type.

Overall, this dashboard serves as a powerful tool for anyone interested in EV trends, government compliance tracking, and data-driven decision-making in the electric mobility space.
